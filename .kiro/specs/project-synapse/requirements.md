# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Project Synapse is a self-learning, zero-cost intelligence network that proactively perceives the web in real-time, understands information at scale, and delivers actionable insights instantly. The system leverages free-tier cloud services and a brain-inspired modular architecture to democratize access to web intelligence through a comprehensive API suite and developer-first platform.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Real-time Web Content Discovery

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to automatically discover new web content from RSS/Atom feeds so that I can access the latest information without manual monitoring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a high-priority feed is configured THEN the system SHALL poll it every 60 seconds
2. WHEN a low-priority feed is configured THEN the system SHALL poll it every 5-10 minutes  
3. WHEN new content is discovered THEN the system SHALL extract article URLs and inject them into the processing queue
4. WHEN feed parsing fails THEN the system SHALL log the failure and retry with exponential backoff
5. IF a feed becomes consistently unavailable THEN the system SHALL reduce polling frequency automatically

### Requirement 2: Intelligent Content Scraping

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to scrape web content efficiently using cached recipes so that I can extract structured data from any website reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a URL needs scraping THEN the system SHALL first check for existing scraping recipes
2. WHEN a cached recipe exists THEN the system SHALL use it for >99% of scrapes
3. WHEN scraping fails THEN the system SHALL trigger learning mode to create new recipes
4. WHEN learning mode is activated THEN the system SHALL use browser automation to analyze the page structure
5. IF anti-bot measures are detected THEN the system SHALL use proxy rotation and Tor network fallback
6. WHEN a new recipe is created THEN the system SHALL store it for future use

### Requirement 3: Resilient Task Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the platform to handle failures gracefully so that no data is lost during outages or service interruptions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the primary database is unavailable THEN the system SHALL store tasks in the fallback queue
2. WHEN database connectivity is restored THEN the system SHALL re-inject queued tasks automatically
3. WHEN a task fails THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff retry logic
4. WHEN maximum retries are reached THEN the system SHALL log the failure and alert administrators
5. IF system load is high THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting to prevent overload

### Requirement 4: Natural Language Processing

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want content to be automatically analyzed and enriched with metadata so that I can access structured insights without manual processing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content is scraped THEN the system SHALL extract entities, sentiment, and categories
2. WHEN text summarization is requested THEN the system SHALL provide both extractive and abstractive summaries
3. WHEN semantic search is performed THEN the system SHALL return relevance-ranked results
4. WHEN bias analysis is requested THEN the system SHALL identify framing patterns and narrative indicators
5. IF NLP processing fails THEN the system SHALL store raw content and retry processing later

### Requirement 5: Developer-First API Suite

**User Story:** As a third-party developer, I want access to comprehensive APIs with clear documentation so that I can integrate web intelligence into my applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing any API endpoint THEN the system SHALL require valid API key authentication
2. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL return structured JSON responses
3. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages
4. WHEN free tier limits are reached THEN the system SHALL prompt for upgrade to paid tiers
5. IF API errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error messages with resolution guidance

### Requirement 6: Real-time Monitoring and Alerts

**User Story:** As a business user, I want to monitor keywords and topics so that I can receive instant notifications when relevant content appears.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a monitoring subscription is created THEN the system SHALL store keywords and webhook configuration
2. WHEN monitored content is discovered THEN the system SHALL send webhook notifications within 60 seconds
3. WHEN webhook delivery fails THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff
4. WHEN subscription limits are reached THEN the system SHALL enforce tier-based restrictions
5. IF webhook endpoints are consistently unavailable THEN the system SHALL pause notifications and alert the user

### Requirement 7: Interactive Dashboard and Management

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want a web dashboard to manage my API usage, view system health, and explore data so that I can effectively utilize the platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users log into the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display API usage statistics and system health
2. WHEN exploring scraped content THEN the system SHALL provide searchable, paginated data views
3. WHEN testing APIs THEN the system SHALL provide interactive sandbox environments
4. WHEN managing subscriptions THEN the system SHALL allow CRUD operations on monitoring rules
5. IF system issues occur THEN the system SHALL display real-time status updates and health metrics

### Requirement 8: Scalable Architecture with Fallback Systems

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want the system to scale automatically and maintain high availability so that users experience consistent performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN traffic increases THEN the system SHALL auto-scale processing components
2. WHEN primary services fail THEN the system SHALL failover to backup systems automatically
3. WHEN database connections are lost THEN the system SHALL use local caching and fallback storage
4. WHEN API response times exceed thresholds THEN the system SHALL implement circuit breakers
5. IF resource limits are approached THEN the system SHALL implement graceful degradation

### Requirement 9: Project Tracking and Integration Management

**User Story:** As a development team member, I want to track project progress and maintain integration consistency so that new features integrate seamlessly with existing systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new task is started THEN the system SHALL update the project tracking file with current status
2. WHEN files are created or modified THEN the system SHALL document changes in the ongoing project log
3. WHEN features are completed THEN the system SHALL verify integration with existing components
4. WHEN architecture changes are made THEN the system SHALL update system documentation automatically
5. IF integration conflicts are detected THEN the system SHALL alert developers and provide resolution guidance

### Requirement 10: One-Click Deployment and Environment Management

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to deploy the entire system with a single command so that I can quickly set up development, staging, and production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deployment is initiated THEN the system SHALL provision all required cloud resources automatically
2. WHEN environment variables are needed THEN the system SHALL use secure configuration management
3. WHEN services are deployed THEN the system SHALL verify health checks and connectivity
4. WHEN deployment fails THEN the system SHALL rollback changes and provide detailed error logs
5. IF resource limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL alert administrators and suggest scaling options
